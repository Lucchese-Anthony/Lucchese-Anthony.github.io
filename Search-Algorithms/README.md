# Search Algorithm Visualization

This web application is a visualization of various search algorithms, including Breadth First Search. Breadth First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing an unweighted Graph or a Tree. The way BFS works is by starting with the root node and exploring each adjacent node before exploring node(s) at the next level. BFS then makes use of Queue for storing the visited nodes of the graph / tree.
